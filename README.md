Spoiler Room is an artist run audiovisual media collective from Portland, Oregon that organizes free social “episodes” and dance parties. The events are shot on analog video with a lo-fi portable TV studio, edited in real-time, and presented as video documents on Portland cable access as well as archived online. Each documented episode is an hour long and generally revolves around a guest DJ or artist that is shot in a constantly changing setting.
