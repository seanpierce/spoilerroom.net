  SPOILER ROOM is an audiovisual media collective from Portland, Oregon that creates site-specific “TV parties” featuring guest DJs doing hour long mixes in a variety of environments.  The video feed is edited on site in real-time, and eventually makes its way to cable access and is archived online here.<br><br>
Spoiler Room promotes experience as a resistance against the corporatization of Portland and the sterilization of the urban landscape by reconnection to places and creating a catalyst for social capital.<br><br>
“The more a city skews itself towards wealthy consumers the harder it is for real culture to take place… The simulations with which real culture is replaced aren’t just worse from an aesthetic point of view, they are worse because they exist solely to promote behavior that improves the profits of the corporations manufacturing them.” - Douglas Rushkoff<br><br>
